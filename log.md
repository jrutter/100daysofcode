### Day 001: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Vue.js

**Thoughts:** I've been hearing about vue.js and wanted to have a play with it. I ran through the basics of how vue.js works, it feels similar to both react and angularjs. Almost a mix of both.

**Resources Used:**  [Vue.js Intro Guide](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/)

**Link to Work:** [Example of Codepen.io] (https://codepen.io/jakerutter/pen/KZmyrq)


### Day 002: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: New app setup using vue.js

**Thoughts:** After doing the intial tutorial yesterday, I thought I would take it a step further to learn a bit more about vue.js and use the cli tool to setup an app. It comes with a fully setup dev environment, very impressed with the CLI. Setup basic view with todo items, tomorrow I will take this a step further.

`npm run dev` - Starts the webpack app for dev mode
`npm run build` - Builds for production

### Day 003: January 1, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Setup CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** I used the CLI to setup another app and this time, Im going to play around with CSS Grids. It's pretty simple to get it started and I'm amazed at how powerful it seems. Although, a bit worried about support for IE11<. I also setup SASS in the webpack config using the tutorial below, pretty simple!

### Day 004: January 2, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Continue working with CSS Grid

**Thoughts:** I copied over the previous day 003 and started from their on building a UI. I want to build a simple web app for stashing your shows and setlists, so I thought a simple form with css grids would be a good start. I want to get more comfortable with the css grids. It's starting to click and I can see the power of them. I like where this is going though, although I think I need to do early morning coding instead of after work.
