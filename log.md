### Day 001: December 30, 2017

**Today's Progress**: Intro to Vue.js

**Thoughts:** I've been hearing about vue.js and wanted to have a play with it. I ran through the basics of how vue.js works, it feels similar to both react and angularjs. Almost a mix of both.

### Day 002: December 31, 2017

**Today's Progress**: New app setup using vue.js

**Thoughts:** After doing the intial tutorial yesterday, I thought I would take it a step further to learn a bit more about vue.js and use the cli tool to setup an app. It comes with a fully setup dev environment, very impressed with the CLI. Setup basic view with todo items, tomorrow I will take this a step further.

`npm run dev` - Starts the webpack app for dev mode
`npm run build` - Builds for production
